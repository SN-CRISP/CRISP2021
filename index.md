# Welcome to the 2021 CRISP meeting

The 2021 [CRISP](https://sn-crisp.github.io/CRISP/) meeting gathers cool, friendly scientists from Portugal, Spain and other countries to work in different aspects of supernovae, their host galaxies, extinction, with methods like integral-field spectroscopy and polarization. CRISP is funded by the Fundação para a
Ciência e Tecnologia through CRISP grant [PTDC/FIS-AST-31546]

## Venue

The meeting will be held at the [Hotel STAR-Inn](https://www.hotelstarinn.com/peniche/) in Peniche, Portugal from the 14th to 18th of July, 2021.

## Presential Participants 

- Ana S. Afonso (CENTRA)
- Ana M. Mourão (CENTRA)
- Antonia Morales Garoffolo (UCádiz)
- Beatriz Pereira (CENTRA)
- João Duarte (CENTRA)
